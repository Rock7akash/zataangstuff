== Features ==

Press the home (menu) button while you are on the SpringBoard to bring up a search bar and a keyboard. Type a few characters and tap to:

  * type in a phone number in the search box and hit "Go" to call 
  * type in something like "yahoo.com" and hit "Go" to visit the page

~~For features you want, please leave a comment on the QuickGoldFeatures page.~~
